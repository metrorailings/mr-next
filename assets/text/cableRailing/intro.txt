We craft our artisan cable railings with pride. Not only that, but we've built so many sections of cable rails that 
we've actually pioneered new ways to build them quicker without compromising on quality.

The wiring we use for the body of the railings is comprised of 19 strands of marine-grade stainless steel threads wound 
together into a tight cable measuring about an 1/8 of an inch in thickness. In our shop, all wires are 
cut to size and crimped into the fittings. Come time for installation, the wiring is ready for installation - we just 
run the wires through the posts and tighten the bolts on the end with a ratchet. Easy as can be.

As we're a shop specially designed to fabricate custom metal products, we can customize the railing frame as much as 
your heart desires. Want to use some bigger posts? No problem. Want to use a wood toprail instead of a metal one? Sure, 
we can do that. Want to incorporate some necks on top of your posts and then have the toprail sit directly on those 
necks? We can make that happen.

If you really want your cable railings to stand out though, we recommend going one step forward painting the cables 
either black or white. It's become a cutting-edge design trend for good reason - the wiring really stands out 
brilliantly when you go the distance and give them a black or white finish.
