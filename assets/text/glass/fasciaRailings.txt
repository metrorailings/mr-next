Looking to go absolutely buck wild when it comes to making the railings as minimalistic as possible? Nothing is more 
minimalistic than fascia-mounted glass railings. Fascia-mounted glass railings entail glass panels being screwed 
directly against the side of whatever ledge or platform needs to be railed. The only metal needed here are the screws 
and caps needed to secure the panels up against the building. Keep in mind this is the only style of glass railing where
holes need to be drilled into the glass so that the screws can travel through the glass and directly into the building.
