The wiring we use for the body of the railings is comprised of 19 strands of marine-grade stainless steel threads wound 
together into a tight cable measuring about an 1/8 of an inch in thickness. In our shop, all wires are 
cut to size and crimped into the fittings. Come time for installation, the wiring is ready for installation - we just 
run the wires through the posts and tighten the bolts on the end with a ratchet. Easy as can be.
