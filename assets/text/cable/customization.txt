As we're a shop specially designed to fabricate custom metal products, we can customize the railing frame as much as 
your heart desires. Want to use some bigger posts? No problem. Want to use a wood toprail instead of a metal one? Sure, 
we can do that. Want to incorporate some necks on top of your posts and then have the toprail sit directly on those 
necks? We can make that happen.
