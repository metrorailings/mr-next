the Owner.

##### 2.2 Changes by Government Order
Any changes to the work required by any government or inspector which increases the cost of construction will be an 
additional cost and will be paid for by the Owner. Any official government order prohibiting or stopping construction 
will excuse the obligation of contractor to complete the work until the order is lifted. If the entry of the government

work contracted or performed by the Contractor at the time of the government order.

Orders setting forth their descriptions and their additional costs/credits to Owner(s). Each Change Order or Site Change
Order shall be signed by Contractor and Owner(s) and Owner(s) shall pay such additional costs at the time such Change 
Order or Site Change Order is signed by Contractor and Owner(s) and prior to commencement of the work.

##### 2.4 Materials
Should any materials provided for in the Contract Documents not be available in the quantities required
at the time needed by Contractor for proper construction progress, Contractor shall have the right, at Contractor's 
election, to substitute equivalent materials available for the same construction purposes. The products to be furnished
will be of reasonable quality, having latitudes of acceptability that are usual and allowable under standard grading 
rules and other recognized construction inspection agencies.

#### PAYMENT SCHEDULE BREAKDOWN

*Deposit Payment*       
When the Owner is ready to hire the Contractor to perform the work outlined on the Quote, the Owner shall pay 
to the Contractor a deposit equal to 50% of the Contract Price. Exceptions can be made on a project-by-project basis.

*Progress Payments*        
Should the Quote explicitly convey that progress payments be made through the course of this contract, the Owner will 
need to pay such progress payments as laid out according to a payment schedule that will be drafted at the same time as 
the Quote. Once drafted, the payment schedule can be considered an exhibit to this Contract.

days of request by Contractor. Payments due and unpaid shall bear interest (at the maximum legal rate) payable to the 
Contractor from the date the payment is due. If the Owner fails to pay the Contractor within 3 business days of 
the date the payment is due, the Contractor may stop the work. The Contractor may keep the job idle until such time as 
any progress payments that are due to the Contractor are paid in full.

materials can be procured immediately after the deposit payment is made by the Owner, fabrication work should not and 
cannot begin until Contractor receives the accurate measurements needed to begin fabrication work on any custom 
product needed for the project. Should Contractor need to visit the site in order to gather such measurements, 
measurements can only be taken when the Site is ready for such custom product. An exception can be granted depending on 
the circumstances, but then Contractor cannot guarantee a high level of quality for whatever it produces to satisfy 
the scope of work outlined in the Quote. Once fabrication begins, the Contractor will be responsible for updating the 
Owner with a timeline. This timeline must be reasonably expedient unless otherwise noted in the Quote.
