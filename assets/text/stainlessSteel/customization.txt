Keep in mind that when it comes to design choices, your options are a bit more limited when it comes to stainless steel 
railings. Design elements aren't as extensive when it comes to stainless steel, especially when most people getting 
stainless steel railings do so with the modern aesthetic in mind. The modern design aesthetic eschews gaudy/flashy 
visual elements in favor of a simpler look. That being said, we're more than happy to work with you if you have a 
particular style of stainless steel railing in mind.
