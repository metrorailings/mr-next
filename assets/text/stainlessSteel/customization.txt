Keep in mind that when it comes to design choices, your options are a bit more limited when it comes to stainless steel 
railings. Design elements aren't as extensive when it comes to stainless steel, especially when most people getting 
stainless steel railings do so with the modern aesthetic in mind. The modern design aesthetic eschews gaudy/flashy 
visual elements in favor of a simpler look. That being said, stainless steel railings are often combined with cable and 
glass components for those folks who really want their railings to stand out. If you have something else in mind 
design-wise, we're more than happy to work with you.
