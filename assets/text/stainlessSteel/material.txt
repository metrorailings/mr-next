Typically, architectural and marine-grade stainless steel are used to build out the railings, depending on whether 
you're ordering railings for interior spaces or outdoor spaces. We can also use other types of stainless steel depending
on the environmental specifics of your project. Regardless, we promise your stainless steel railings will ultimately 
come out beautiful.
