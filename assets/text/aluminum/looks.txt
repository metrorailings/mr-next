But our aluminum railings don't sell themselves just because they promise one less headache for homeowners - they 
also sell because they look damn good (frankly speaking). Ever since Metro Railings was founded, aluminum railings have 
been our bread and butter. Even though we've been priding ourselves lately on our cable and glass railings, we still 
build more traditional aluminum railings than any other railing. Not only are they by far the most affordable style of 
railing we offer, but they exude that simple element of luxury that works so well with older houses. For those who want 
to keep things simple and yet still want better railings than the slop they sell over at Home Depot, consider 
custom-built aluminum railings.
