For decades, people have been using wrought iron to build out custom metal railings. It wasn't until the late 90s that 
people began using aluminum instead to construct metal railings. Why aluminum? Quite a few reasons - it's more 
affordable, easier to manipulate, easier to handle, and (most importantly) corrosion-resistant. We can't emphasize that 
last point enough - with aluminum railings, you'll won't have to worry about repainting your railings every couple years
or watching your railings eventually rust away to nothing. Aluminum railings are built to survive for decades without 
you needing to much to maintain them.
